# Design and Development of a Database for a Travel Agency

This is one of my university projects where I practiced in prototyping and developing a database for a travel agency, adding testing data to the DB and writing queries, procedures, and triggers.

## The Idea of the Project
1. Select a business to create a DB for,
2. Dig deeper into what problems this type of business usually faces and how they can be solved with the help of a database,
3. Design and deploy a database based on how this business works,
4. Add testing data to the tables and **provide practical use cases of the database using queries, procedures, and triggers**.

## Tech Stack
1. ERwin Data Modeler - logical and physical modeling
2. Microsoft SQL Server & Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - deploying the database and working with it

## Results
### Theoretical Part (Data Modeling)
1. The type of business selected was "Travel Agency",
2. After thorough research, it became clear what entities and relationships between them should be added to the database to match the business processes,
3. Firstly, the logical model was created in ERwin Data Modeler, and the structure of the data model was checked for consistency with 3NF,

5. After that the physical model of the database was created as well as the script to create all the tables and relationships in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS),

7. After the DB was created, testing data was added to all the tables,
8. The second important part of this project was providing use cases of the database based on usual business needs.

### Practical Part (Use Cases of the DB)
